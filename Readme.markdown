This is a Web UI to display document that generated by [Bard](https://github.com/wb14123/bard) framework.

Demo
----------

You can see a [live demo](http://doc-ui.bardframework.com/). Fill `http://crud.example.bardframework.com/api-doc`
 in the input field and click `Get Document`. You should be able to see the documents.

Requirements
---------

* Node.js
* Grunt
* Bower

Build
---------

```
npm install
bower install
grunt build
```

Then copy the generated directory `dist` to you static web server.

Or you can use `grunt serve` to run a server at localhost.

Extend
----------

Since the document generated from Bard framework is extensible, you may want to extend the elements
that the UI displays. That is simple, just write some HTML in `/app/views/main.html`. It uses AngularJS,
and `doc` is the document object.
